# Northwind Data Modeling Project

![Data Warehouse Model Screenshot](dw.png)

Welcome to the Northwind Data Modeling Project repository. This project aims to create a robust data warehouse model for the Northwind dataset, a sample database often used for learning and testing data warehousing concepts. The project is mentored by Eng. Ahmed Emad as part of the Data Modeling Bootcamp.

## Project Overview

The Northwind Data Modeling Project focuses on designing a data warehouse (DW) that captures the essence of a fictional company's operations, including suppliers, customers, employees, products, and sales orders. The goal is to provide an organized and efficient platform for performing complex analytics, reporting, and data-driven decision-making.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `DW_creation.sql`: SQL script for creating the data warehouse schema, fact table, and dimension tables.
- `Date_table.sql`: SQL script for creating the date dimension table, crucial for time-based analysis.
- `Type.txt`: Documentation explaining the types of dimensions used in the project (Type 0, 1, 2, 3).
- `Profiling.docx`: Profiling details for each dimension table, including cardinality, dimension type, and any unique characteristics.
- `dw-screenshot.png`: A screenshot or visualization of the Northwind Data Warehouse model.
- `README.md`: You're reading it! An introduction to the project and its components.

## Type of Dimensions

For an in-depth understanding of the dimension types used in the Northwind Data Warehouse, please refer to [Type_of_Dimensions.md](Types.txt).

## Dimension Profiling

Detailed profiling information for each dimension can be found in [Profiling_for_Dimensions.md](Profiling.docx).

## Mentorship

This project is mentored by Eng. Ahmed Emad, a data modeling expert with vast experience in designing efficient data warehouses. The mentorship is part of the Data Modeling Bootcamp, where you'll gain valuable insights into data modeling best practices.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Eng. Ahmed Emad for his guidance and mentorship throughout the project.
